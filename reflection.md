Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.
I worked with Laisha Koon Perez on this assignment!

- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?
We did a snapshot Mario game and focused on compiling a character with the different things he can do. We gave the option of Mario or Luigi.
- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?
We added a generic character class so there would be the option of Mario and Luigi and then it described which one was chosen.
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Listing out everything at first helped a lot! We planned ahead so we knew what to do when we were coding. Psuedocode.
Making things specific to the game
The booleans in fly and walk - we tried if statements, but that didn't work, had to find a way to make it work with integers
